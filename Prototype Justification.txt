Statement of Prototype Choice:

~Vertical Prototype:
	The current program contains detailed individual data structures each complete with their own methods for
	insertion and deletion. Driver implements a few of the tasks the team aims to accomplish by the deadline.
	Data structures such as the Graph and B+ Trees have not yet been implemented. There are a few data structures
	that have been fully implemented such as the Binary Search Tree and the AVL Tree.
~Evolutionary Prototype:
	Though the Driver has not implemented the insertion and deletion for all data structure, the few that are
	implemented with great detail. The functioning parts of the driver are done with a great degree of quality.
	The driver is generic allowing different data types to be stored. It also produces the formatting required
	by Vula for the question pools based on the user input.
	The team intends to add onto the current driver to create a graphical user interface and implement the
	functions of this project using the Driver

The methods have been tested and inheritance has been used as each tree data structure (aside from the b+ tree)
extend the Binary Tree.
